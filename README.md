# License-Plate-Detection-Using-Yolov4-Model-OCR

Introduction:
License plate recognition systems are now essential in contemporary uses, such as traffic
control, security enforcement, toll collection, and automated parking. These systems depend
on the capacity to precisely identify and read license plates from images or video streams of
vehicles, even in difficult circumstances. The procedure generally consists of two main stages:
locating the license plate area and retrieving the alphanumeric symbols.
In this paper, we examine a joint method that utilizes YOLOv5, a powerful object detection
algorithm, alongside Easy OCR, a flexible and efficient optical character recognition tool.
YOLOv5 is recognized for its swift and precise object detection, making it ideal for real-time
localization of license plates. Easy OCR enhances this by offering dependable character
recognition, even in cases of noisy or partially hidden inputs.
This method is assessed using a varied dataset to examine its efficiency under various
environmental circumstances, such as low light and angled perspectives of license plates. The
proposed system seeks to offer a practical and scalable solution for license plate recognition
that aligns with the needs of real-world applications by leveraging the advantages of YOLOv5
and Easy OCR.
